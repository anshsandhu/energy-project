# energy-project
data science for energy systems final project
1. **wind-solar-functions**
    i. **CSV file** : contains wind power curves data
    ii. **PYNB file** : contains master wind and solar functions
    
2. **screenshots-of-power-curve-wind**
    i. **JPEG file** : contains wind power curves screenshot as found on the internet
    
3. **final-applying-ga-to-all-cities**
    i. **combining-all-cities.pynb** : first run this to create csv file named "combined-cities-dataset"
    ii. **normalising-energy-data.pynb** : run this to normalize data and obtain csv file named "df_input-to-ga"
    iii. **ga-on-normalised-data.pynb** : run this to perform genetic algorithm and get the required sizing of hybrid renewable system
    
4. **cleaned-cities-dataframe-with-power-values**
    i. **CSV file** : contains cities data along with the power values for each type of wind turbine and solar panel used
    
5. **data-cleaning**
    i. **CSV files** : contains various data cleaning files based on individual cities weather data
    ii. **PYNB files** : long form converter files and other data cleaning processes
